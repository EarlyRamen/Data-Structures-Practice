Splay Trees 
    - BST
    - much faster than all BST when freg. accessing the same elements
    - Cache managemnt systems
    - Crypto  
    - Like AVL, rotations after Add, Remove, Find

Def. Splay Tree is a BST that does NOT self balance. 
     Access if a particular Node, X, becomes the root of the tree.
     To optimeize Temperal Locality 
        -Temperal refers to timing
        -Spactial refers to Location

Terms
    - Zig: One rotation for adding entry 
    - Zig-Zig: One way rotations all the way to the top for adding entry
    - Zig-Zag: Init rotation is different from the rest of the rotations all the way to the top. 
    - Amortized: average worst case analysis 

M-way Search Tree
    - each node can have at most m children
    - each non-leaf node must have at least 2 children
    - each node can have up to m-1 keys
    - The nodes keys k1<k2<k3<k4....
    - Promote and seperate by bias if a node is out of space

2-4 Tree
    - m-way seach tree
    - each non-leaf node must have at least 2 children
    - A node can have up to 4 childrens
    - each node can have 3 keys
    - All levels are at the same depth
