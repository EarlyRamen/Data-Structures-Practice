Min Spanning Tree
    - Prim's
    - Kruskals
    - Remove loop and double edges before applying 

Shortest Path
    - Dijkstra
        - Step Cost: weight to traverse an edge
        - Path Cost: Sum of step costs along a path from the source to every other node

        Let P(u) be the path cost from the source to vertex u

        P(u) + C(u,v) < P(v) than P(v) = P(u) + C(u,v)
