Bucket Sort O(n)
    1. An array of N elements to sort
    2. Create an array of bucket of size N.
    3. Find the range (0 to C) of numbers by finding the max.
    4. The range of each bucket array slot is determine bt range/N. [0,range)
    5. Put numbers into the bucket array into corresponding range.
    6. Do insertion sort on bucket that has two or more elements. 
        - Stats about it
            36% 1 or less
            73% 2 or less
            91% 3 or less
            98% 4 or less
            99.5% 5 or less
    
Radix Sort O(n) for time and space
    - The radix or base is the number of unique digits, including the digit zero, used to represent numbers. 
      For example, for the decimal system the radix is ten, because it uses the ten digits from 0 through 9. 
    
    1. Create an array of bucket that has size of the radix(base 10 has size 10, base 2 has size 2)
    2. Values of the Least sig digit determines the subscript to put into
    3. Check second to least sig digit and so on
    4. Copy elements back to original array by the order they added to the last bucket array
       (bucket array of bit 3 in case of 4 bit binary)

Selection(finding Kth element in the sorted array but the array is not sorted currently) O(logn)
    1. Find a pivot point and partition the array into 2.
    2. If pivot is k, return. Othewise if k<pivot, partition on the left side, and if k>pivot, partition on the right.
