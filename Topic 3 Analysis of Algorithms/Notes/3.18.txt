    -Big O()
        -Worst-Case Estimate; Does not contain constant
        f(n)=2n+cn
        g(n)=n
        f(n)=O(n)

        Let f(n) and g(n) be functions that map to some non-negative output. 
        -We say that f(n)=O(c*(g(n))) if there is a constant c>0 and an integer constant n0>1 that f(n) is less or equal to
        c*g(n) for all n>=n0. 


    -Big Omega()
        -Best Case
         Let f(n) and g(n) be functions that map to some non-negative output. 
        -We say that f(n)=Omega(c*(g(n))) if there is a constant c>0 and an integer constant n0>1 that f(n) is greater or 
        equal to c*g(n) for all n>=n0.
